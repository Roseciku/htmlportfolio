<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Rosemary! from Kenya, an agribusiness graduate but currently working as a call representative in a healthcare billing company. Funny! Right? Anyway, that’s just me, I’m open minded and like to have new experiences. In addition to that, I currently decided to add my skills by learning programming. Of all the skills, why programming? First, I have usually really wanted to improve my understanding about the world. Technology runs the world today, and developing programming skills can help me understand how things work around me. For instance, I can be able to keep up with the new technologies. Second is to augment my marketability for new jobs. In the modern world, a person who has pursued programming skills is a more appealing candidate to a recruiter. Therefore, adding this skill increases your flexibility in the job market.</p>

<p>Also, with what I have been told before and learnt so far, is that programming improves one’s creativity, reasoning and attention to detail skills. Who doesn’t want to have such skills!? Programming requires you to write logical codes and also helps you learn to find places where you have accidentally made mistakes into the code. All this requires logical thinking which can be helpful in other real-world situations. Furthermore, something as tiny as a punctuation mark can mess up your piece of code. Learning to code helps you develop your attention to detail because it necessitates you to look precisely and fast for possible inaccuracies and aids you to practice to avoid such faults.</p>
